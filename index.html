    <p class="greeting">Hey, I'm John!</p>
    <p>I'm a student at Rutgers University pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.</p>
    <p>I'm also involved in Persian Club, Arab Club, Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists, and Spikeball Club!</p>
    <p>
      Last summer I was a SWE Intern at HubSpot, where I used Java, Dropwizard, Kafka, and SQL to contribute to 
      <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/integrations/content-library">HubSpot's Integrations</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was also an Undergraduate Researcher through Rutgers University's 
      <a href="https://lsamp-nb.rutgers.edu/">LSAMP</a> scholars program. I conducted research on AI for Intelligent 
      Transportation, collaborating with federal agencies to improve transportation safety across the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that, I worked at 
      <a href="https://ecoverse.io">EcoVerse</a>. There, I worked on the Event Infrastructure team using React, Solidity, 
      TypeScript, and Firestore to create and optimize the campaign creation pipeline for brands.
